        Some first graders struggle to understand the concept of addition. Below are five evidence-based practices you
        can use when teaching students how to add. They do not need to be used in any particular order. Research has
        shown that these high-impact strategies benefit all students—and are especially effective for students with
        learning and attention issues.

      Provide frequent opportunities for students to practice fact retrieval.

      The Challenge:
      Calculation Fluency
      Fluency with mathematical procedures is a
      common area of struggle for students with learning and attention
      issues. Speed in computation is a significant predictor of a student’s
      performance in solving word problems: With faster computation comes
      better problem-solving performance.

      The Growth Opportunity: Fluency and Conceptual Understanding
      Opportunities to practice rapid recall of
      addition facts will further strengthen fluency. Families can play
      addition bingo at home to help students build fluency.
    </div>
    <p>Activity: 3</p>
    <div>Addition Bingo

      A fun way to practice fact fluency is
      to play addition bingo. Give each student a bingo board. Instruct
      students to choose a number from 2 to 12 and write it in a random box on
      the board. Repeat until all boxes have been filled (without repeating
      any numbers).
      Pair up students and give each pair
      two dice. To play, Player A rolls the dice and adds the numbers together
      to find the sum. Player B should verify that the sum is correct. If
      students have the sum on their bingo boards, they can cover the square
      with a coin or other object.
      Students take turns until one player completes a row, column, or diagonal line and calls out “addition bingo.”


      Differentiate:
      For students who struggle with recalling addition facts, use oversize
      dice so they can count the dots as needed. Provide instruction on using a
      number line or other manipulatives to gradually diminish the use of
      counting and to work toward building their fluency.

      Practice Counting Strategies

      Review a progression of
      counting strategies. Start with “counting all” (a strategy that students
      are likely familiar with). Students count the first addend in an
      addition sentence, count the second addend, and then count both addends
      together. (If you choose to use the term “addend,” define it as “a
      number being added to another.”) For instance, for 4 + 2, students would
      count 1, 2, 3, 4, and then 1, 2, and finally 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

      Then progress to “counting on.” Students start
      with the first addend and then count on to include the second addend.
      Again, for 4 + 2, students would say 4, and then count on 5, 6. This makes counting more efficient, as it skips
      the step of counting each addend separately.

    </div>
    <p>Activity: 2</p>
    <div>

      Give each student 5 counters that
      are red on one side and yellow on the other (or similar manipulatives).
      Put the counters in a line with 3 showing the red side and 2 showing
      yellow.

      Review “counting all” by leading students in counting all the red counters. Tell students to touch each counter as
      they count: 1, 2, 3.

      Do the same with the yellow counters: 1, 2.

      Then, lead the class in “counting all” of the counters together: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.


      Next, explain that the “counting
      on” strategy will save them time when they count. This time, use 6
      counters to show 2 red counters + 4 yellow counters. Lead students in
      naming the first addend: 2. Instead of counting the yellow counters separately, “count on” to include them with
      the first set: 3, 4, 5, 6.


      Explain to students that they have added the two groups. Ask them how many counters they have in all.


      Reveal that students can be even faster at
      “counting on.” Teach them to start with the greater addend in the
      addition sentence. To add the same 2 red counters and 4 yellow counters
      as above (2 + 4), they should start with 4 and then count on 2 red
      counters: 5, 6. This helps students become even more efficient in their counting.


      As an extension or an exit ticket,
      have students flip the counters to show any combination of red and
      yellow counters that still total 6 in all (or any number you select).
      Have them model “counting on” for you.

      The Challenge:
      Understanding Counting Principles

      There are five principles to counting:

      Stable order
      One-to-one correspondence
      Cardinality
      Abstraction
      Order irrelevance

      Students who struggle with one or more of these principles can have difficulty learning addition.


      The Growth Opportunity:
      A Toolbox of Counting Strategies
      As students work with addition, they
      will have to fluidly combine counting principles, so it is helpful to
      practice them together. Developing a counting strategy, and then
      progressively using a more efficient strategy, helps students learn the
      counting principles needed for understanding addition.

      The Challenge:
      Flexible Thinking
      Flexible thinking is difficult for many
      students. Estimation requires flexibility in thinking because students
      are not asked to provide the actual answer to a problem. Instead, they
      are asked to make predictions about possible answers. The uncertainty
      inherent to predictions requires students to consider many
      possibilities, which is a key aspect of flexible thinking.

      The Growth Opportunity:
      Building Estimation Skills Estimation
      is a key skill in mathematics. Using a number line can help students
      improve both estimation skills and flexibility in thinking.

      Representing numbers and the
      relationships between numbers on a number line is also an important
      intermediate step in mathematical understanding. Number lines help to
      bridge the gap between concrete understanding (such as counting and
      moving objects) and mental math. Being skilled at using a number line
      has been shown to be one of the most significant predictors of future
      success in math.

      Estimate Sums
      Teach students to
      use a number line
      to estimate the
      Sum.


    </div>
    <p>Activity: 3</p>
    <div>
      Number Line Estimation Using 5-Groups

      Give students a copy of the number
      line from 0 to 10. Have them use their pointer finger to show the shaded
      section from 0 to 5. Instruct students to point to the number 5 as the
      middle of the number line. Explain that 0 to 5 are shaded to show a
      “5-group.” For students who struggle, practice identifying single
      numbers as closer to 5 or 10 prior to moving on to estimating sums.
      Next, prompt students to estimate the
      sum of 6 + 3 using the number line as a visual guide. Ask students if
      the sum will be closer to 5 or 10. Have them explain their responses.
      Students may say that the 6 already pushed past 5, so several more jumps
      on the number line would get them close to 10. (The focus here should
      be purely on estimating, not adding.)
      Repeat this procedure with other problems. Challenge students to explain how the number line helps them to
      estimate the sum.

  <h1>Changes and Notes by Phil 20 Dec 2018</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduced to three lessons</li>
    <li>Tidied HTML: removed empty spacers, separated style from content</li>
    <li>Metadata is now in JSON-LD in relevant sections</li>
    <li>Changed main entity to typeof ocx:SupplementalMaterial*</li>
    <li>ocx:teaser is not currently defined, removed it</li>
    <li>Gave LessonPlan section elements identifiers, and changed type to CreativeWork and oer:Lesson</li>
    <li>deleted ocx:activity-number and ocx:activity-standards properties </li>
    <li>broadened the scope of the Activity so that it covers all three columns of the table row (tr)</li>
    <li>gave the Activity tr identifiers and changed type to CreativeWork and oer:Activity</li>
    <li>Note: I am not sure that we need both Lesson and Activity parts as each Lesson has only one Activity</li>
    <li>Changed hasPart relationships to be ocx:material relationships from oer:Activity to [new] ocx:SupplementalMaterial</li>
    <li>All three cells in each activity are identified as material for activity</li>
    <li>Changed typeOf to typeof in several places</li>
    <li>Changed property="learningResourceType" to property="ocx:partType" where content="Overview"</li>
    <li>fixed error in oer: URI</li>
  </ul>
    <p>*I'm not entirely happy about a Curriculum Guide having parts
that are Lessons and Activities, but that's where we are at the moment.</p>

              <p><span>Review</span><span>&nbsp;a progression of
counting strategies. Start with “counting all” (a strategy that students
 are likely familiar with). Students count the first addend in an
addition sentence, count the second addend, and then count both addends
together. (If you choose to use the term “addend,” define it as “a
number being added to another.”) For instance, for 4 + 2, students would
 count </span><span style="font-style:italic">1, 2, 3, 4</span><span>, and then </span><span style="font-style:italic">1, 2</span><span>, and finally </span><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:italic">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</span></p>
              <p><span>Then progress to “counting on.” Students start
with the first addend and then count on to include the second addend.
Again, for 4 + 2, students would say</span><span style="font-style:italic">&nbsp;</span><span>4</span><span>, and then count on </span><span style="font-style:italic">5, 6</span><span class="1">. This makes counting more efficient, as it skips the step of counting each addend separately.</span></p>

                <li><span class="1">Give each student 5 counters that

                <li>
                  <span>Review “counting all” by leading students in counting all the red counters. Tell students to touch each counter as they count:</span><span style="font-style:italic">&nbsp;1, 2, 3.</span>

                  <span>Next</span><span>, explain that the “counting
on” strategy will save them time when they count. This time, use 6
counters to show 2 red counters + 4 yellow counters. Lead students in
naming the first addend: </span><span style="font-style:italic">2</span><span>. Instead of counting the yellow counters separately, “count on” to include them with the first set: </span><span style="font-style:italic">3, 4, 5, 6. </span>

                <li>
                  <span>Reveal that students can be even faster at
“counting on.” Teach them to start with the greater addend in the
addition sentence. To add the same 2 red counters and 4 yellow counters
as above (2 + 4), they should start with 4 and then count on 2 red
counters: </span><span style="font-style:italic">5, 6</span><span>. This helps students become even more efficient in their counting. </span>

better problem-solving performance. </span></p>

line from 0 to 10. Have them use their pointer finger to show the shaded
 section from 0 to 5. Instruct students to point to the number 5 as the
middle of the number line. Explain that 0 to 5 are shaded to show a
“5-group.” For students who struggle, practice identifying single
numbers as closer to 5 or 10 prior to moving on to estimating sums.</span></li>

sum of 6 + 3 using the number line as a visual guide. Ask students if
the sum will be closer to 5 or 10. Have them explain their responses.
Students may say that the 6 already pushed past 5, so several more jumps
 on the number line would get them close to 10. (The focus here should
be purely on estimating, not adding.)</span></li>

            <p><span class="2">Flexible Thinking </span></p>
            <p><span class="1">Flexible thinking is difficult for many
students. Estimation requires flexibility in thinking because students
are not asked to provide the actual answer to a problem. Instead, they
are asked to make predictions about possible answers. The uncertainty
inherent to predictions requires students to consider many
possibilities, which is a key aspect of flexible thinking. </span></p>

            <p><span style="font-weight:700">Building Estimation Skills </span><span class="1">Estimation
 is a key skill in mathematics. Using a number line can help students
improve both estimation skills and flexibility in thinking. </span></p>

            <p><span class="1">Representing numbers and the
relationships between numbers on a number line is also an important
intermediate step in mathematical understanding. Number lines help to
bridge the gap between concrete understanding (such as counting and
moving objects) and mental math. Being skilled at using a number line
has been shown to be one of the most significant predictors of future
success in math.</span></p>

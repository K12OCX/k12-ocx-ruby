              <p><span>Review</span><span>&nbsp;a progression of 
counting strategies. Start with “counting all” (a strategy that students
 are likely familiar with). Students count the first addend in an 
addition sentence, count the second addend, and then count both addends 
together. (If you choose to use the term “addend,” define it as “a 
number being added to another.”) For instance, for 4 + 2, students would
 count </span><span style="font-style:italic">1, 2, 3, 4</span><span>, and then </span><span style="font-style:italic">1, 2</span><span>, and finally </span><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:italic">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</span></p>
              <p><span>Then progress to “counting on.” Students start 
with the first addend and then count on to include the second addend. 
Again, for 4 + 2, students would say</span><span style="font-style:italic">&nbsp;</span><span>4</span><span>, and then count on </span><span style="font-style:italic">5, 6</span><span class="1">. This makes counting more efficient, as it skips the step of counting each addend separately.</span></p>

                  <span>Review “counting all” by leading students in counting all the red counters. Tell students to touch each counter as they count:</span><span style="font-style:italic">&nbsp;1, 2, 3.</span>

counters to show 2 red counters + 4 yellow counters. Lead students in

                  <span>Reveal that students can be even faster at 
“counting on.” Teach them to start with the greater addend in the 
addition sentence. To add the same 2 red counters and 4 yellow counters 
as above (2 + 4), they should start with 4 and then count on 2 red 
counters: </span><span style="font-style:italic">5, 6</span><span>. This helps students become even more efficient in their counting. </span>

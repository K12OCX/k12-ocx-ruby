          Estimate Sums
          Teach students to

          to estimate the
          Sum.

          Number Line Estimation Using 5-Groups

          Give students a copy of the number
          line from 0 to 10. Have them use their pointer finger to show the shaded
          section from 0 to 5. Instruct students to point to the number 5 as the
          middle of the number line. Explain that 0 to 5 are shaded to show a
          “5-group.” For students who struggle, practice identifying single
          numbers as closer to 5 or 10 prior to moving on to estimating sums.
          Next, prompt students to estimate the
          sum of 6 + 3 using the number line as a visual guide. Ask students if
          the sum will be closer to 5 or 10. Have them explain their responses.
          Students may say that the 6 already pushed past 5, so several more jumps
          on the number line would get them close to 10. (The focus here should
          be purely on estimating, not adding.)
          Repeat this procedure with other problems. Challenge students to explain how the number line helps them to
          estimate the sum.

        <h4>Rationale</h4>
        <p>
          The Challenge:
          Flexible Thinking
          Flexible thinking is difficult for many
          students. Estimation requires flexibility in thinking because students
          are not asked to provide the actual answer to a problem. Instead, they
          are asked to make predictions about possible answers. The uncertainty
          inherent to predictions requires students to consider many
          possibilities, which is a key aspect of flexible thinking.


          The Growth Opportunity:
          Building Estimation Skills Estimation
          is a key skill in mathematics. Using a number line can help students
          improve both estimation skills and flexibility in thinking.


          Representing numbers and the
          relationships between numbers on a number line is also an important
          intermediate step in mathematical understanding. Number lines help to
          bridge the gap between concrete understanding (such as counting and
          moving objects) and mental math. Being skilled at using a number line
          has been shown to be one of the most significant predictors of future
          success in math.

          Addition Bingo

          A fun way to practice fact fluency is
          to play addition bingo. Give each student a bingo board. Instruct
          students to choose a number from 2 to 12 and write it in a random box on
          the board. Repeat until all boxes have been filled (without repeating
          any numbers).
          Pair up students and give each pair
          two dice. To play, Player A rolls the dice and adds the numbers together
          to find the sum. Player B should verify that the sum is correct. If
          students have the sum on their bingo boards, they can cover the square
          with a coin or other object.
          Students take turns until one player completes a row, column, or diagonal line and calls out “addition bingo.”


          Differentiate:
          For students who struggle with recalling addition facts, use oversize
          dice so they can count the dots as needed. Provide instruction on using a
          number line or other manipulatives to gradually diminish the use of
          counting and to work toward building their fluency.

        <h4>Rationale</h4>
        <p>
          The Challenge:
          Calculation Fluency
          Fluency with mathematical procedures is a
          common area of struggle for students with learning and attention
          issues. Speed in computation is a significant predictor of a student’s
          performance in solving word problems: With faster computation comes
          better problem-solving performance.


          The Growth Opportunity: Fluency and Conceptual Understanding
          Opportunities to practice rapid recall of
          addition facts will further strengthen fluency. Families can play
          addition bingo at home to help students build fluency.

          Practice Counting Strategies

          Review a progression of
          counting strategies. Start with “counting all” (a strategy that students
          are likely familiar with). Students count the first addend in an
          addition sentence, count the second addend, and then count both addends
          together. (If you choose to use the term “addend,” define it as “a
          number being added to another.”) For instance, for 4 + 2, students would
          count 1, 2, 3, 4, and then 1, 2, and finally 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

          Then progress to “counting on.” Students start
          with the first addend and then count on to include the second addend.
          Again, for 4 + 2, students would say 4, and then count on 5, 6. This makes counting more efficient, as it
          skips the step of counting each addend separately.

        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="activity1-1pt2">
        <h4>MainContent</h4>
        <p>


          Give each student 5 counters that
          are red on one side and yellow on the other (or similar manipulatives).
          Put the counters in a line with 3 showing the red side and 2 showing
          yellow.

          Review “counting all” by leading students in counting all the red counters. Tell students to touch each
          counter as they count: 1, 2, 3.

          Do the same with the yellow counters: 1, 2.

          Then, lead the class in “counting all” of the counters together: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.


          Next, explain that the “counting
          on” strategy will save them time when they count. This time, use 6
          counters to show 2 red counters + 4 yellow counters. Lead students in
          naming the first addend: 2. Instead of counting the yellow counters separately, “count on” to include them
          with the first set: 3, 4, 5, 6.


          Explain to students that they have added the two groups. Ask them how many counters they have in all.


          Reveal that students can be even faster at
          “counting on.” Teach them to start with the greater addend in the
          addition sentence. To add the same 2 red counters and 4 yellow counters
          as above (2 + 4), they should start with 4 and then count on 2 red
          counters: 5, 6. This helps students become even more efficient in their counting.


          As an extension or an exit ticket,
          have students flip the counters to show any combination of red and
          yellow counters that still total 6 in all (or any number you select).
          Have them model “counting on” for you.

      <div id="activity1-1pt3">
        <h4>Rationale</h4>
        <p>

          The Challenge:
          Understanding Counting Principles

          There are five principles to counting:

          Stable order
          One-to-one correspondence
          Cardinality
          Abstraction
          Order irrelevance

          Students who struggle with one or more of these principles can have difficulty learning addition.


          The Growth Opportunity:
          A Toolbox of Counting Strategies
          As students work with addition, they
          will have to fluidly combine counting principles, so it is helpful to
          practice them together. Developing a counting strategy, and then
          progressively using a more efficient strategy, helps students learn the
          counting principles needed for understanding addition.
